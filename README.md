# landing-page

The Odin Project

Foundations Course at 64% requires me to create a landing page.
Starting from scratch, I am supposed to create a webpage of their design, but still a generic landing page. The only guideline I have is the definition of colors and fonts.

I started with creating the barebones of the html file, and then filled the page with content. From there I started seperating each sections in order to get started on the css file.

I created the css file and started defining the main selectors. I noticed that I needed to divide the content even further to make the flex boxes work. Then I went ahead to narrow down the custom selectors.

After narrowing them down and giving them values, I tried to get as close to the actual design as possible.
